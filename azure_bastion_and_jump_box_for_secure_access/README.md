# Azure Secure Deployment Guide

## 📌 Overview
This repository contains a step-by-step guide to securely deploying an **Azure Virtual Network (VNet), Virtual Machine (VM), and Azure Bastion** while ensuring controlled access and security best practices.

## 🚀 Deployment Steps
1. **Create Resource Group and VNet** – Establish a foundational network architecture.
2. **Deploy a VM in a Private Subnet** – Prevent direct public exposure.
3. **Deploy Azure Bastion Host** – Enable secure remote access without public IP.
4. **Remove Public IP from VM** – Strengthen security posture by restricting direct internet access.
5. **Test Access via Bastion** – Validate secure connectivity to private resources.
6. **Configure Just-in-Time (JIT) VM Access** – Enhance security by limiting VM access windows.

## 🔐 Security Considerations
- Utilize **Microsoft Defender for Cloud** to monitor threats.
- Regularly review **role-based access controls (RBAC)**.
- Enable **logging and monitoring** for compliance and security audits.

## 📄 Documentation
For detailed deployment steps, refer to **[Deployment Steps.md](steps.md)**.

## 📌 Next Steps
Consider integrating:
- **Azure Policy** for governance and compliance.
- **Azure Monitor & Log Analytics** for real-time visibility.
- **Azure Key Vault** for secure credentials management.
