# Azure Governance Deployment Guide

## 📌 Overview
This repository outlines the **step-by-step process** for establishing **Azure governance** with management groups, policies, RBAC roles, and cost management strategies.

---

## 🚀 Deployment Steps
1. **Create a Management Group and Subscription** – Establish a structured hierarchy.
2. **Define Budgets and Cost Alerts** – Set financial controls for spending limits.
3. **Apply Tags to Resources** – Improve organization, tracking, and automation.
4. **Create and Assign Azure Policies** – Enforce governance rules for compliance.
5. **Configure RBAC Roles** – Set permissions for secure access control.
6. **Document and Visualize the Structure** – Maintain clarity with architecture diagrams.

## 🔐 Security Considerations
- Apply **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** to limit permissions.
- Use **Azure Policy** to enforce security and compliance.
- Enable **Microsoft Defender for Cloud** for proactive threat protection.
